# Runtime Validation

This runbook records the current README/SPEC runtime boundary that has been
proved against the Rust-first implementation. Use it when checking whether the
engineering preview is runnable, and update it whenever a README-visible
capability moves in or out of the proofed boundary.

## Contract Summary

The proofed contract is taken from `README.md`, `SPEC.md`, and
`docs/architecture/overview.md`:

- Browser UI talks to the Rust API on `:4003` over HTTP and `/ws`.
- The Rust API owns auth, tenant scope, agent lifecycle, persisted work state,
  WebSocket fanout, jobs integration, and the internal MCP bridge.
- The Rust orchestrator runs on `:4010`, persists its own workflow domain, and
  starts the Temporal worker when Temporal is enabled.
- Temporal runs the live workflow runtime on `:7233`; the UI is on `:8233`.
- PostgreSQL is required. Redis, NATS, MinIO, Docker, and Temporal are part of
  the default `prod-ext` proof path.
- Container CLI task execution flows through sidecar, NATS, Rust API jobs,
  persisted task/run/evidence state, and browser-visible task surfaces.

## Current Proof

Last validated on 2026-05-13 from the repository root using `make prod-ext`.

### Stack Health

Run:

```bash
make prod-ext
docker ps --filter 'name=agentforge-'
curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:4003/health
curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:4003/api/health
curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:4010/health
docker exec agentforge-temporal temporal operator cluster health --address temporal-internal:7233
docker exec agentforge-nats wget -qO- http://localhost:8222/healthz
```

Expected evidence:

- `agentforge-server`, `agentforge-orchestrator`, `agentforge-temporal`, and
  `agentforge-nats` are `healthy`.
- API `/health` returns `{"ok":true,"status":"healthy"}`.
- API `/api/health` returns `status:"ready"` with `database`, `docker`,
  `nats`, and `redis` checks true.
- Orchestrator `/health` returns `{"status":"healthy"}`.
- Temporal cluster health is `SERVING`.
- NATS monitoring health is `{"status":"ok"}`.

### Orchestrator Schema Contract

The orchestrator uses its own database URL and SQLx migration history. The
legacy integer-key orchestrator tables are preserved under
`legacy_orchestrator` and replaced with UUID-key Rust-owned tables.

Run:

```bash
cd rust
DATABASE_URL=postgres://agentforge:devpassword@127.0.0.1:45432/agentforge \
  cargo test -p agentforge-orchestrator --test schema_contract
```

Expected evidence:

- `fresh_schema_matches_rust_owned_uuid_contract` passes.
- `legacy_integer_schema_is_preserved_and_replaced_with_uuid_tables` passes.
- In a migrated external orchestrator DB, `_sqlx_migrations` includes
  `8 | adopt legacy integer schema`, public workflow/task/review/knowledge/audit
  key columns are `uuid`, and legacy rows remain under
  `legacy_orchestrator.*_legacy_int`.

### Temporal Workflow

Use the orchestrator internal token and tenant headers to create a one-node
gate workflow through `POST /api/v1/workflows`, then run it through
`POST /api/v1/workflows/{id}/run`.

Expected evidence:

- Workflow creation returns a UUID workflow id and one node.
- Run returns `status:"running"`, a Temporal workflow id formatted as
  `orchestrator-<workflow-id>`, and a non-empty Temporal run id.
- Polling `GET /api/v1/workflows/{id}/status` reaches `status:"completed"`.
- The gate node reaches `status:"completed"` with output
  `{ "passed": true, "reason": "all dependencies completed successfully" }`.

### WebSocket Event Fanout

Use a real login token from `POST /api/v1/auth/login`, connect to
`ws://127.0.0.1:4003/ws?token=<token>` with the configured production Origin,
then publish JSON to `broadcast.<org-id>` through NATS backend credentials.

Expected evidence:

- The WebSocket connection upgrades with the real JWT.
- A JSON payload published to the tenant broadcast subject is received by the
  WebSocket client unchanged.

### Browser To Sidecar Task Path

Run the focused Playwright proof against the local Vite UI and `prod-ext`
backend:

```bash
cargo build -p agentforge-sidecar
npm run dev:client -- --host 127.0.0.1 --port 4002

BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:4002 \
ORCHESTRATION_REAL_E2E=1 \
ORCHESTRATION_REAL_E2E_CLEANUP_AUTH=1 \
E2E_EMAIL=dev@example.com \
E2E_PASSWORD=DevPass123! \
E2E_DATABASE_URL=<api-database-url-with-host-127.0.0.1> \
NATS_PORT=4222 \
npx playwright test --config tests/e2e/playwright.config.ts \
  tests/e2e/specs/orchestration-real-task.spec.ts --project chromium
```

Expected evidence:

- The test logs in with the real auth endpoint.
- It seeds a workspace, team, project, group, agent, participant, and scoped
  token through `POST /api/v1/auth/switch-context`.
- The browser creates an assigned task from the task board.
- The local `agentforge-sidecar` subscribes to the NATS assignment subject,
  executes the configured Container CLI path, reports completion, and the task
  reaches `completed`.
- A page reload shows the completed task and evidence marker.

### LLM Provider Connection Test

Run the focused Rust route proof with a test database URL:

```bash
cd rust
DATABASE_URL=<api-database-url-with-host-127.0.0.1> \
  cargo test -p agentforge-api routes::llm_providers::tests
```

Expected evidence:

- The provider settings test endpoint decrypts the stored user API key through
  the Rust encryption key path.
- The route builds a provider instance through the shared LLM gateway factory.
- The successful test returns `ok: true` with the provider and model.
- Error payloads redact upstream provider bodies and never echo API keys.

## Preview Boundaries

These surfaces are intentionally outside the proofed runtime boundary until
they have implementation and validation evidence:

| Surface                         | Current state                       | Required next step                                                                          |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `GET /api/v1/agents/:id/git`    | Returns an empty placeholder shape. | Implement real git status collection or keep it documented as unavailable.                  |
| `POST /api/v1/voice/transcribe` | Stub route.                         | Wire a real provider-backed transcription path and tests, or remove it from active UI/docs. |

Do not broaden README claims until this runbook contains a command that proves
the capability end to end.
